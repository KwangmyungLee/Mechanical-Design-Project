# Mechanical Engineering Projects

This repository contains two major mechanical design projects I completed during my engineering studies:

1. **Wheelchair Lift Design Project**  
2. **Gear Pump Design Project**

Both projects include full CAD models, engineering drawings, calculations, stress analysis, and safety verification. These were completed as part of coursework during college and are posted here to showcase past engineering work.

# 1️⃣ Wheelchair Lift Design Project

The wheelchair lift project is a full mechanical design of an automotive lift system (inspired by BraunAbility NCL-Series).  
This project includes CAD assemblies, manufacturing drawings, detailed FBD-based force analysis, stress analysis, and safety factor validation following ADA standards.

## 📂 Files Included (Wheelchair Lift)

- Wheel Chair Lifter Drawing.pdf — Full 2D drawing package  
- Wheel Chair Lifter Project.pdf — Engineering report (~200 pages)

## 📝 Overview

The goal of this project was to:

- Reverse engineer an existing lift system  
- Rebuild the entire assembly in SolidWorks  
- Analyze all forces during Lift-Up and Lift-Down positions  
- Perform manual stress and safety calculations  
- Verify ADA-required Safety Factor = 3

## 🛠 Key Components Designed

- Top/Bottom parallel arms  
- Vertical support arms  
- Hydraulic cylinder configuration  
- Pivot arms (horizontal/vertical)  
- Platform + bridge plate  
- Handrail  
- Pins & joints  
- Tower base structure

# 2️⃣ Gear Pump Design Project

This is a full mechanical design project for a gear pump including shaft design, gear bending/wear calculations, bearing selection, key/keyway design, and housing analysis.

## 📂 Files Included (Gear Pump)

- Gear Pump Design Project.pdf — Full design report  
- Includes:
  - Shaft design  
  - Gear analysis  
  - Bearing selection  
  - Housing design  
  - Safety factor tables  
  - Drawings and appendices  

## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on designing a high-efficiency gear pump with:

- 10 HP input  
- 1500 RPM operating speed  
- 3.25 in bearing spacing  
- 13-tooth gears (DP = 4)  
- Housing efficiency = 0.7

Both primary and secondary shafts were redesigned multiple times to meet safety requirements.
